This code will simulate data for multiple digital health metrics for a reference (e.g., neurologically intact) and a target (e.g., neurologocially impaired) population. Based on these data, the proposed multi-step metric selection framework will be applied an all evaluation criteria and plots from the paper will be generated. 

This approach is expected to be applicable for any 1D, discrete digital health metric for that data for a neurologically intact and impaired population is available.
The framework allows the selection of robust metrics that have highest potential for repeatedly assessing impairments, eg for longitudinal studies.
