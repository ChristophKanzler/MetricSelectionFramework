%KMO Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy.
% Factor analysis can be used as a guide to how coherently a set of variables
% relate to a hypothesized underlying dimension that they are all being used
% to measure. External validity analysis assesses whether the scale that has
% been constructed performs as theoretically expected in correlation with
% other variables to which it is expected to be related.
% There are some assumptions about the characteristics of factors that are
% extracted and defined that are unobserved common dimensions that may be
% listed to account for the correlations among observed variables. Sampling
% adequacy predicts if data are likely to factor well, based on correlation
% and partial correlation. Is used to assess which variables to drop from the
% model because they are too multicollinear.
% It has been suggested that inv(R) should be a near-diagonal matrix in order
% to successfully fit a factor analysis model.  To assess how close inv(R)
% is to a diagonal matrix, Kaiser (1970) proposed a measure of sampling
% adequacy, now called KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) index. The common part, called
% the image of a variable, is defined as that part which is predictable by
% regressing each variable on all other variables.
% The anti-image is the specific part of the variable that cannot be predicted.
% Examining the anti-image of the correlation matrix. That is the negative of the
% partial correlations, partialling out all other variables.
% There is a KMO statistic for each individual variable and their sum is
% the overall statistic. If it is not > 0.6 drop the indicator variables with
% the lowest individual statistic value until the overall one rises above 0.6:
% factors which is meritorious. The diagonal elements on the Anti-image 
% correlation matrix are the KMO individual statistics for each variable. A KMO
% index <= 0.5 indicates the correlation matrix is not suitable for factor
% analysis.
%
% Syntax: function kmo(X) 
%      
%     Input:
%          X - Input matrix can be a data matrix (size n-data x p-variables)
%     Output(s):
%            - Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Index.
%            - Degree of Common Variance Report (shared by a set of variables
%              and thus assesses the degree to which they measure a common
%              underlying factor).
%        optional(s):
%            - Anti-image Covariance Matrix.
%            - Anti-image Correlation Matrix

%  Example: From the example given on the web page
%  http://www.ncl.ac.uk/iss/statistics/docs/factoranalysis.html
%  We are interested to calculate the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling
%  adequacy in order to see if proceeds a satisfactory factor analysis to
%  investigate the reasons why customers buy a product such as a particular
%  brand of soft drink (e.g. coca cola). Several variables were identified
%  which influence customer to buy coca cola. Some of the variables identified
%  as being influential include availability of product (X1), cost of product
%  (X2), experience with product (X3), popularity of product (X4), prestige
%  attached to product (X5), quality of product (X6), quantity of product (X7),
%  and respectability of product (X8). From this, you designed a questionnaire
%  to solicit customers' view on a seven point scale, where 1 = not important
%  and 7 = very important. The results from your questionnaire are show on the
%  table below. Only the first twelve respondents (cases) are used in this
%  example.
